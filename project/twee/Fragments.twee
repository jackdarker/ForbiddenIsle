<h2>How not to win</h2>
</br>- try to trigger badends by ignoring hints pushed into your face
</br>- if your sanity decreases below zero you will get either a special or generic bad end. 
</br>- dont worry. If you end the game - good or bad - you will get the chance to start New-Game-Plus

<h2>Common tips</h2>
</br>- You need to eat and drink. If you dont, you get weak and might do stupid things if getting desparate.
</br>- Look around if you can find some food or other useful things. Some of the snackbars you start with you better save for later.

<p hidden>Somehow that isle is tainted and when eating or drinking something it might change you. Not immediatly, but on a longtime range. So you better not eat everything you find.</p>
</br>- Your chances to scavenge something increase if you get more familiar with your surrounding. However, resources migth need some time to regrow, so you better move on at a point. 
</br>- a bonfire keeps you warm and animals away. Gather some wood.

<p hidden>...but also attract interest of - visitors.</p>
</br>- spend some time to fix your clothing before it falls apart. You dont want to run around nude, do you?

<h2>More indeep spoilers</h2>
<a0 onclick='(function($event){document.querySelector("#"+id+"~p").toggleAttribute("hidden");})(this);'>Triggering transformation</a>
<p hidden> - Its not just eating double melons and you grow "double melons".
</br> - if you eat or drink something or are otherwise exposed to mutators, those mutators will accumulate in your body
</br> - only if a trigger is applied a evaluation of the mutators is done to select a transformation. F.e. going to sleep. 
</br> - The selection depends on the size of each mutator relative to the others, their absolute size and the transformations already present.
</br> - F.e. if your Tits are already large and those mutators indicate a average breast expansion, it will do nothing 
</br> - multiple mutators have to be present. Lets say there are mutators A,C,T,G. 
</br> For a average breast expansion a relation A:C:T:G of around 2:1:0:0 with C beeing at least 0.5. 
</br> C you get from Peaches while A can be obtained from Melons. But Peaches also increase T, so you need to find something that decreases it.
</br> ??? - there should be a hint to player what kind of mutator got accumulated (" there is some odd tension in your chest")  
</br> - The executed transformation will consume the mutators
</br> - mutators dimish over time. Stay away from tainted things to reduce there accumulation. 
</br> - immuno boosters increase the dimishing rate while other things increase it 
</br> - a weakend condition or preference might reduce the threshold of a transformation or maintains a minimum level of a certain mutator
</br> - 

</br> - your body fights against the transformation and their is a chance to recover some

The hard work at the day takes it toll on you and the night passes with a deep, dreamless sleep.

Its surprisingly cold and the fire burnt already down. Shivering from the cold, you wish to have something wrap yourself into or to cuddle with someone.
The only one around to cuddle with is Eric and thats [[Not an option]] | [[Ask him]]  

Your mind switches to dream mode:...


:: FI_NGPShop
This is the New-Game-Plus Screen where you can configure your next play through.
<p class="author">
- Some game-events (BadEnds, maxing out Stats, some missions) may grant you either a NGP-token or reduce the cost of a NGP option.
- spend those tokens here to make your life easier (or harder)
- if you get a ingame notification that a option can be enabled for free, you can also activate them ingame. All other options need to be configured before game start.
- Options with negative cost will give you credit that can be spent for other options. 
- Earned tokens you dont spent get carried over in the new game but not (!) tokens you get credited for taking options with negative cost.
